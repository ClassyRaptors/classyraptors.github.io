				Hey! My name is Timothy Welman and I am studying Integrated Digital Media at New York University. This space is meant to be where I start writing about myself and all my acheivements that I think are notable enough so that people think I am cool and want to give me a job as a result. I will write something better here at a later time, but for now I will just continue to type whatever comes to my mind just so I can fill up the space on the page and make it look like I have a lot of cool things to say about myself. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Will you please give me a job, because I really could use one so my parents can stop bugging me about it. Thank you.
